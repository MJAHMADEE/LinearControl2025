# Linear Control Systems (Fall 2025)
**K. N. Toosi University of Technology**

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Linear Control Systems course for the Fall 2025 semester. This repository serves as the central hub for all course materials, including lecture notes, assignments, code samples, and important announcements.

## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the analysis and design of feedback control systems. Students will learn the fundamental principles of modeling dynamic systems, analyzing their time and frequency responses, and designing controllers to achieve desired performance specifications. Topics include system representation using transfer functions and state-space models, stability analysis, root locus techniques, frequency-domain analysis (Bode and Nyquist plots), and the design of classic controllers like PID, lead, and lag compensators. The course aims to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical engineering applications.
