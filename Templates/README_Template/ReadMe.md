# README Templates for Linear Control 2025

This directory contains standardized README file templates for projects and assignments for the Linear Control 2025 course. The goal of these templates is to ensure that all submissions are well-documented, consistent, and easy to understand.

## Available Templates

This directory provides two versions of the README template to accommodate both English and Persian submissions:

* **`README_Template_En.md`**: The official template for creating a project README in **English**.
* **`README_Template_Fa.md`**: The official template for creating a project README in **Persian (Farsi)**.

## How to Use

To use these templates for your own project, please follow these steps:

1.  **Choose Your Language**: Decide whether you will be writing your documentation in English or Persian.
2.  **Copy the Content**: Open the corresponding template file (`_En.md` for English, `_Fa.md` for Persian) and copy its entire raw content.
3.  **Create Your README**: Go to the root directory of your assignment or project folder. Create a new file named `README.md` (if one doesn't already exist).
4.  **Paste and Edit**: Paste the copied template content into your new `README.md` file.
5.  **Fill in the Details**: Carefully replace all placeholder text and instructions (e.g., `[Project Title]`, `[Your Description Here]`, etc.) with your project's specific information.
6.  **Review**: Read through your completed README to ensure it is clear, accurate, and professional.
